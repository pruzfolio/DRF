# Django REST Framework (DRF) Learning Roadmap

## 1. Beginner Level

### Topics:
- [ ] **Introduction to APIs and DRF**
  - [ ] What are REST APIs?
  - [ ] DRF setup and installation.
  - [ ] DRF project structure: serializers, views, URLs, models.

- [ ] **Building a Simple API**
  - [ ] Serializers: `ModelSerializer` and basic serializers.
  - [ ] APIView basics: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
  - [ ] Setting up API routes.

- [ ] **Django ORM Basics in DRF**
  - [ ] Querying the database for API data.
  - [ ] Understanding QuerySet and filtering.

- [ ] **API Testing with DRF**
  - [ ] Using Django’s test client for API testing.
  - [ ] Tools like Postman and cURL for manual testing.

- [ ] **Introduction to DRF Browsable API**
  - [ ] Understanding how to navigate and test APIs in the DRF browsable interface.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Start with DRF’s official quickstart guide.
- [ ] Use interactive API-building tutorials, like *Django for APIs* by William S. Vincent.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] Build a Todo List API:
  - [ ] Features: Create, read, update, delete tasks.
  - [ ] Use basic serializers and APIView.

## 2. Intermediate Level

### Topics:
- [ ] **ModelSerializer in Depth**
  - [ ] Using `ModelSerializer` for CRUD operations.
  - [ ] Overriding serializer methods (e.g., `create`, `update`, `validate`).

- [ ] **Viewsets and Routers**
  - [ ] Understanding `ModelViewSet`, `ViewSet`.
  - [ ] DRF routers: `DefaultRouter`, custom routes.

- [ ] **Authentication and Permissions**
  - [ ] DRF’s built-in authentication.
  - [ ] Permission classes (e.g., `IsAuthenticated`, `IsAdminUser`).
  - [ ] Custom permission classes.

- [ ] **Pagination**
  - [ ] Built-in pagination classes (e.g., `PageNumberPagination`, `LimitOffsetPagination`).
  - [ ] Customizing pagination styles.

- [ ] **Filtering, Searching, and Ordering**
  - [ ] Integrating `django-filter` for query-based filtering.
  - [ ] Adding search and ordering to APIs.

- [ ] **Nested Serializers**
  - [ ] Serializing related objects.
  - [ ] Handling One-to-Many and Many-to-Many relationships.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Work on integrating DRF with your existing Django models.
- [ ] Explore Postman to test authentication flows.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] Build a Blog API:
  - [ ] Features: CRUD operations for posts and comments.
  - [ ] Implement authentication for users to manage their own posts.
  - [ ] Add pagination and search for posts.

  - [ ] Handling nested input data.
  - [ ] Overriding `perform_create` and `perform_update` methods in views.

- [ ] **Throttling and Rate Limiting**
  - [ ] Using DRF’s built-in throttling classes.
  - [ ] Custom throttling strategies.

- [ ] **Advanced Querying**
  - [ ] Using `annotate` and `aggregate` for calculated fields.
  - [ ] Optimizing database queries for large datasets.

- [ ] **Content Negotiation**
  - [ ] Understanding content types (`application/json`, `application/xml`).
  - [ ] Customizing the response renderer.

- [ ] **File Uploads in APIs**
  - [ ] Uploading files and images via API.
  - [ ] Handling media files in DRF.

### Suggestions:
- [ ] Focus on real-world scenarios like managing large datasets or securing APIs.
- [ ] Read articles on DRF optimization techniques.

### Hands-On:
- [ ] Build a Photo Gallery API:
  - [ ] Features: User authentication, upload photos, like and comment on photos.
  - [ ] Add JWT authentication.
  - [ ] Implement rate limiting for non-authenticated users.
